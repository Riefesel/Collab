                    <p> Remote sensing is the scanning of earth by sensors stationed on a satellite or aircraft. To create a 3D visualization of woodlots in the Larose Forest, the area was scanned using a Light Detection and Ranging method of remote sensing. Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR for short, uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure the height of objects relative to the surface of the earth. The height of objects are determined by the time it takes for the light pulsed laser from the sensor to hit earth and then be bounced back and received by the sensor.</p>

                    <h4>LiDAR Point Cloud Data Processing</h4>
                     <p> Point cloud data was acquired through CRIBEâ€™s ArcGIS Enterprise, where it was then downloaded to a local hard drive and unzipped using the LAStools Software. Once the point cloud data was unzipped, the 45Gb LiDAR point cloud tile set brought into ArcGIS Pro. Two subset LAS Datasets were created from the initial tile set covering woodlot 22A and 25B. 
                    </p>  
                    <p> Point cloud data received from our client was unclassified, and therefore the team ran a classification process on both LAS datasets to classify point clouds into overlap, noise, ground, buildings, and vegetation classes.

                    <h3 class="underlineTitle">Spatial Analysis</h3> 
                    <p> This segment in our methodology covers the process of locating possible new trail routes for those trails that will be impacted by forest harvesting, as well
                        as the calculations of income generated by forest harvesting.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Determining Where Harvesting Will Take Place</h4>
                    <p> Our client had provided a polygon layer of all the forest woodlots.  Detailed information for each woodlot included the year of proposed harvesting
                        as well as the suggested harvest method.  The client requested we investigate only the woodlots that are in the current 5-year operations plan (spanning 
                        the years 2021 to 2025), and requested we focus exclusively on the 2022-to 2025 time frame.  The woodlot (polygons), trailheads (points), and trails (polylines)
                        would serve as the primary operational layers in this application.
                    </p> 
                    <p> Upon further discussion with the client and the UCPR forest manager, the decision was made to focus on hiking and biking trails since these are the most popular trails,
                        and the ones most impacted by trail closures.  So although some woodlots are being harvested in the 2022-2025 time frame, if they have no trails or if there are trails 
                        that are not hiking or cycling, they were not considered for analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Parameters for Analysis</h4>
                    <p> These parameters were investigated as inputs for the least cost path analysis:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Distance to Water</li>
                            <li>Distance to Roads</li>
                            <li>Distance to Houses or Buildings</li>
                            <li>Soil Drainage</li>
                            <li>Age of Trees within Forest Stands</li>
                            <li>Ground Slope</li>
                            <li>TYpe of Proposed Harvesting</li>
                            <li>Year of Proposed Harvesting</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If portions of the recreational trails are affected, a least cost path analysis was carried out to suggest an alternative route for a trail by-pass. The team created 
                        a weighted cost surface of the Larose Forest from the criteria listed above that will influence trail quality. An example of alternative trails can be seen below, where the
                        existing trails are shown in green, and the proposed trails are in red.    
                    </p>

                    <h4>Forest Income</h4>
                    <p> By querying the forest woodlots polygon, the team was able to deduce which areas were to be harvested in the 2022 to 2025 time frame.  In addition, the area of each
                        harvest, the tree species, and the biomass volume data could be extracted from the GIS.  Based on input from the client, approximate income streams from each woodlot
                        was calculated in ModelBuilder models.  Should prices change from year to year, a simple change to the unit rate re-calculates potential income to current values.  Having 
                        this information, the client can show to the public the financial benefits of harvesting that could potentially be re-invested back into  Larose Forest infrastructure.  
                        TO BE CONTINUED ONCE I"VE RUN THE MODELS.
