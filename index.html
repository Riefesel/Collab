                <article>
                    <div class="ContentParagraph">
                        <p> Many  forested  landscapes  neighboring  urban  hubs  are  used  both  for  wood  harvesting  and  for recreational  activities.  In  cases  where  public  access  is  permitted  for  recreational  use,  private landowners often end up balancing the economic value of wood products and the demands of recreators  using  the  land  for  activities.  Communicating  the  necessity  for  harvesting  and  forest management to public stakeholders can be challenging. Providing accessible resources that the public can readily understand to demonstrate how harvesting income provides funding to upkeep recreational  infrastructure  is  key  to  creating  quality  relationships  between  private  woodlot owners and recreational stakeholders.

                    <h3 class="underlineTitle">Case Study</h3>
                    <div><h4>The Larose Forest</h4> 
                        <p> In the early 19th century, eastern Ontario had a very active logging industry to supply lumber for the English navy and its shipbuilding industries. Once the old-growth forest had been depleted, loggers harvested smaller trees while farmers burned forests to clear land forcrops.  By the early 20th century, the land in what is now the United Counties of Prescott and Russell (UCPR) was a blow-sand desert, called the Bourget desert. In the 1920s, the provincial agricultural representative for the area, Ferdinand Larose, put forward the idea of reforestation to combat desertification. The county bought the initial 490 hectares of desert-like land from farmers in 1928 and planted the first stands in the Larose Forest. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Since the initial purchase of the land,  the  county  has  continued  to  acquire  land  to  its  current  size  of  11,000 Ha. Replanting  efforts  focused  on  pine  and  spruce  plantations  resultng  in a dominant coniferous species composition in the Larose Forest. The Larose Forest  is  still  actively  managed by the UCPR  with  a  20-year forest  management  plan  approved  in  2008.  Although the primary mandate for the forest is land stewardship with sustainable timber harvesting, the Larose Forest has become a popular site for recreational activities where the forest is coveniently located 50 kilometers east of Canada's capital city, Ottawa. The forest now  includes  a  multitude  of  recreational  trails  for  hiking,  mountain  biking,  horseback  riding, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, dog sledding, dirt biking, ATVing, hunting, and snowmobiling. The county recognizes that its forest harvesting must minimize the impact of the public’s use of its popular trails.
                        </p></div>
                    <div><h4>Our Approach</h4> 
                        <p> In this project, a web application will be constructed to communicate forest management operations to public stakeholders of the Larose Forest.  Using  recreational  trail  data  provided  by  the  UPCR,  Light  Detecting  and  Ranging (LiDAR) derived data, and the Larose Forest Management Plan, a web application will be created using Esri’s Experience Builder with embedded 3D Scenes and visualizations of the relationships between  the  harvesting  plan  and  recreational  trail  systems.  The  aim  of  this  project  is  to effectively  communicate  and  visualize  forestry  management  practices  of  privately  owned woodlots that have recreational value to community stakeholders.
