                    <div class="ContentParagraph">
                        <p>Many forested landscapes near urban hubs are used both for wood harvesting and for recreational activities. In cases where the public has access to private land
                        for recreational use, private landowners often end up balancing the economic value of wood products with the demands of land-use recreational activities. Communicating
                        the need to harvest and manage the forest to the public can be challenging.  A key to creating a quality relationship between private woodlot owners and recreational 
                        stakeholders is to demonstrate to the public how harvesting income provides funding to upkeep recreational infrastructure.   Private landowners need web-accessible 
                        resources for the public to readily understand that responsible forest management benefits all.

                    <h4>The Larose Forest</h4> 
                        <p> In the early 19th century, eastern Ontario had a very active logging industry to supply lumber for the English navy and its shipbuilding industries. Once the 
                            old-growth forest had been depleted, loggers harvested smaller trees while farmers burned forests to clear land for crops.  By the early 20th century, the land 
                            in what is now the United Counties of Prescott and Russell (UCPR) was a blow-sand desert. In the 1920s, the provincial agricultural 
                            representative for the area, Ferdinand Larose, put forward the idea of reforestation to combat desertification. The County bought the initial 490 hectares of 
                            desert-like land from farmers in 1928 and planted the first stands in the Larose Forest. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Since the initial purchase of land,  the  County  has  continued  to  acquire  land  to  its  current  size  of  11,000 Ha. The Larose Forest  is  actively managed 
                            by the UCPR  with  a  20-year forest  management  plan  approved  in  2008.  Although the primary mandate for the forest is land stewardship with sustainable 
                            timber harvesting, the Larose Forest has become a popular site for recreational activities since the forest is coveniently located 50 kilometers east of Canada's 
                            capital, Ottawa. The forest now  includes  a  multitude  of  recreational  trails  for  hiking,  mountain  biking,  horseback  riding, snowshoeing, cross-country
                            skiing, dog sledding, dirt biking, ATVing, hunting, and snowmobiling. The County recognizes that its forest harvesting must minimize the impact of the public’s 
                            use of its popular trails.

                        <p> The Center for Research & Innovation in the Bio-economy, CRIBE, requested the team create a web application to communicate forest management operations to public 
                            stakeholders of the Larose Forest.  Using  recreational  trail data  provided  by  the  UCPR,  Light  Detecting  and  Ranging (LiDAR) derived data, and the Larose 
                            Forest Management Plan, a web application was created using Esri’s Experience Builder with embedded 3D Scenes and visualizations of the relationships between  the 
                            harvesting  proposed by the plan  and  its impact on recreational  trail  systems.  The  aim  of this  project  is  to effectively  communicate  and  visualize  
                            forestry  management  practices  of  privately  owned woodlots that have recreational value to community stakeholders.
